- Lots of optional features we could use to teach ourselves
- Once you know how to make a blog , it becomes apparent how much of the internet uses the same basic functionality

## Day Three 

### Goals
1. Switch from using H2 in- memory storage to an external file for persistent data storage

2. Have our Home Page (index) pull BlogPosts from the database instead of our current inconsistent array 

3. Add the ability to Edit (and overwrite ) and existing blog post 
4. Add the ability to Delete an existing blog post 

### Optional Goals (for time )
1. Add Edit button to result page to be able to immediately edit a post you just created 
2. Write some JS/jQuery to create confirmation pop-up when trying to delete a post
